## 3.0.0-beta.1 - 2018-04-03

> {warning} Feed Me 3.0.0 is a major release with significant, breaking changes. Be sure to back up your existing Feed Me 2.x.x settings. In most cases, you'll be required to re-map fields to your feed data, as this has been heavily changed and improved.

### Added
- Support for Craft 3, and all that comes with it.
- Support for CSV importing.
- New settings pane for each feed (on the Feeds page) stores useful links for Debug, Duplicate and Direct Feed URL.
- Primary Element setup is now much easier/clearer with preview of available nodes, rather than a text input. Should help with understanding this critical setting. Full preview coming in v3.1
- Unit tests for parsing logic, feed consumption and more.
- Added more hooks for feed fetching, element parsing, field parsing, and processing.
- Added `limit` and `offset` parameters when running a feed via the Direct Feed URL or Debug.
- Added mapping option for selecting to always use the default value, even when not mapping the field. Handy for mass populating data without feed values.
- Added support for pipe `|` character to separate multiple field contents for element fields. Useful when Categories for instance are supplied as `Category 1|Category 2`. This is also the only method of mapping multiple items to a single field when using CSV.

### Changed
- Completely re-written parsing logic for feed data, supported by unit tests. This is boring to most, but exciting for the stability of the plugin :)
- Improved handling of attribute mapping, now more options for things like dates. Now acts and uses the same logic for fields.
- Better handling of default field values under the hood.
- Lots of smaller improvements pathing the way to more major changes in 3.1.0.
- Better support for uploading remote assets (a little faster too).
- When running from the command line (curl, wget, etc), feed processing will wait until it's finished before ending the request.
- Improved UI for mapping complex fields (Matrix, Table). Includes setting collapsed state for Matrix fields.
- Improved UI for mapping sub-element fields. Fields are hidden by default and can be toggled to provide better visual clarity.
- Improved UI for logs, also shows log 'type' to easily pick up errors.
- When a feed fails or contains errors it will no longer show the red error symbol for the queue job. Errors are recorded in the logs, but it won't cause other queue jobs to prevent being run, and notifying clients of an error.
- Logs now capture additional information of line/file when exceptions occur.
- utilise Guzzle for all HTTP requests, rather than new instances of Curl.
- Improved Help widget to utilise API for sending emails, not relying on local relay. Caused immeasurable amount of issues for people try to get support!

## 2.0.11 - 2017-12-14

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrectly setting `localeEnabled` behaviour for entries.
- Fixed issue related to backups, causing feeds to fail when triggered via the control panel.

- Fix for info/notice log messages not saving when `devMode` is off.

## 1.3.0 - 2015-11-25

- Refactored direct processing to utalize Craft's tasks service, rather than using pure PHP processing. This greatly improves performance as PHP processing would run out of memory extremely quickly.

## 1.2.9 - 2015-11-25

- Added support for [SuperTable](https://github.com/engram-design/SuperTable).
- Added log tab to read in `craft/storage/runtime/logs/feedme.log`.
- Added help tab, allowing users to submit their feed info and setup for debugging/troubleshooting.
- Fix for fields in Matrix blocks only succesfully mapping textual fields. Complex fields such as Assets, Entries, etc were not mapping correctly.
- Fix for only one item being processed when Delete duplication handling was selected.
- Fix for Dropdown/RadioButtons causing a critical error when a provided value didn't exist in the field.
- Added credit and plugin url to footer.

## 1.2.8 - 2015-11-25

- Move changelog - so much change!
- Add support for attribute values for XML feeds (template tags only).
- Add missing log statement for successful update/add.

## 1.2.7 - 2015-11-25

- Fix where entries would not import if mapping element fields had more values that their field limit.
- Fix for multiple matches found on existing categories, where only one should match.
- Fix for escaping special characters in tags/category name.
- Minor fix for tags/category mapping.

## 1.2.6 - 2015-11-25

- Fix for matching fields containing special characters.
- Fix for tags and category mapping, mapping all available if supplied empty value.
- Fix for backup lightswitch reflecting the saved state.
- Fix to ensure at least one duplicate field is checked.

## 1.2.5 - 2015-11-25

- Refactoring for performance improvements.
- Remove database logging until a better performing option is figured out. Logging still occurs to the file system under `craft/storage/runtime/logs/`.
- Added optional backup option per-feed (default to true).
- Minor fix so direct feed link doesn't use `siteUrl`.

## 1.2.4 - 2015-11-25

- Added support to fallback on cURL when `file_get_contents()` is not available. Can occur on some hosts where `allow_url_fopen = 0`.

## 1.2.3 - 2015-11-25

- Primary Element is no longer required - important for JSON feeds.
- Fixes for when no primary element specified. It's pretty much optional now.
- UI tidy for mapping table.
- Fix for duplication handling not matching in some cases. Now uses element search.

## 1.2.2 - 2015-11-25

- JSON feed support.

## 1.2.1 - 2015-11-25

- Matrix support.
- Table support.
- Even better element-search.

> [!WARNING]
> - After updating, you will need to re-map and re-save any feeds that use a Matrix field with a nested complex fields (Google Maps, Table, etc.).
> - Feed Me now logs to the database by default.
>   - This may lead to an increase in database size if logs are not cleared. To customize this behavior, see [Customizing Logs](README.md#customizing-logs).
>   - Consider configuring the `logging` setting to `'error'` to reduce logs.

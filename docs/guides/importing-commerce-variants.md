# Importing Commerce Variants

This guide will serve as a real-world example of importing Commerce Products into [Craft Commerce](http://craftcommerce.com). We'll be importing two T-Shirt products into Commerce, each with their own set of variants. This guide specifically deals with **multiple-variant** products.

#### Things to note

- We've got multiple products, and multiple variants. Product information should be stored under each variant.
- `sku` is compulsory for each variant
- `length`, `width`, `height` and `weight` should all be units according to your Commerce settings
- We have a `title` for the product, and `title`'s for each variant

Choose either the XML or JSON (depending on your preference), and save as a file in the root of your public directory. We'll assume its `http://craft.local/variants-feed.xml`.

## Setup your Feed

With your feed data in place, go to Feed Me's main control panel screen, and add a new feed.

![Feedme Variants Guide Setup](../screenshots/feedme-variants-guide-setup.png)

Enter the following details:

- **Name** - Products
- **Feed URL** - `http://craft.local/variants-feed.xml`
- **Feed Type** - _XML or JSON_
- **Element Type** - Products
- **Commerce Product Type** - Clothing (or similar)
- **Import Strategy** - `Create new elements`, and `Update existing elements`
- **Passkey** - Leave as generated
- **Backup** - Turn on

Click the _Save & Continue_ button to set up the primary element.

## Primary Element

The primary element can be confusing at first, but its vitally important to ensure Feed Me can hone in on the content in your feed correctly. Refer to [Primary Element â†’](../feature-tour/primary-element.md) for a detailed explanation.

Enter the following details:

- **Primary Element** - `/products/product`
- **Pagination URL** - `No Pagination URL`

Click the _Save & Continue_ button to set up the field mapping.

## Field Mapping

Use the below screenshot as a guide for the data we want to map to our product fields.

![Feedme Variants Guide Mapping](../screenshots/feedme-variants-guide-mapping.png)

#### Things to note

- Our unique identifier is the Variant SKU - simply as its unique to each product.
- We have some custom fields for Products and Variants mapped.

* * *

Click the _Save & Import_ button to begin importing your content.

## Importing your Content

Wait for the feed processing to finish. Remember, you can always navigate away from this confirmation screen.

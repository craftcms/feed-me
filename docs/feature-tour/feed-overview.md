# Feed Overview

Go to the main Feed Me section via your CP sidebar menu. You'll be presented with a table listing of your saved feeds, or none if you haven't set any up yet.

This overview shows the following:

- **Name** - Name your feed something useful so you'll remember what it does.
- **Feed URL** The URL to your feed.
- **Type** - The data type you're importing.
- **Element Type** - The element type you are importing into.
- **Element Group** - Depending on the element type chosen. Entries will show Section/Entry Type, Categories will show Group, etc.
- **Strategy** - What [import strategy](creating-your-feed.md#import-strategy) you have chosen: how you'd like to handle duplicate feed items (if you're going to be re-running this feed).
- **Run Feed** - Runs the feed immediately
- **Settings (icon)** - Additional settings pane (see below).
- **Delete (icon)** - Delete this feed (be careful).

### Settings Pane
Clicking on the settings cog icon will expand additional settings for each feed.
- **Feed Status** - Takes you to an overview screen showing the process of your feed if currently running.
- **Debug Feed** - Opens in a new window and runs the [Debug action](../troubleshooting.md#debugging).
- **Direct Feed URL** - Can be used in your [Cron job setup](trigger-import-via-cron.md) to directly trigger the job.
- **Duplicate Feed** - Duplicates this feed and all settings into a new feed.

Create a new feed by pressing the red _\+ New Feed_ button in the top-right, or click on the Name column in your table. You'll then be taken to [Create your Feed â†’](creating-your-feed.md).

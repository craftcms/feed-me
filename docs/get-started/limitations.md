# Limitations

FeedMe tries its best to cover as many use cases as possible to facilitate ingestion of content into Craft. There are, however, some known limitations that you should be aware of.

## Multilanguage sites and Matrix fields

When importing content in a site part of a group and in a multi-language scenario, FeedMe is unable to selectively update content for a specific language for matrix blocks and will end up overwriting the field content for all sites and languages in the site group.

# Installation & Setup

Installing Feed Me is as simple as any other Craft plugin - just drop the `feedme` folder in your `craft/plugins` directory and install.

## Installation

1. [Download the latest version](/craft-plugins/feed-me/pricing) of Feed Me and unzip.
2. Copy the `feedme/` directory into your `craft/plugins/` directory.
3. Inside the Craft control panel, navigate to _Settings → Plugins_.
4. Locate the row showing the Feed Me plugin and click _Install_.

## Settings

With Feed Me now installed, you'll be able to access to the plugin settings. Here you can:

- **Plugin name** - just in case you're not a fan of `Feed Me`.
- **Cache duration** - used to save request when calling via template tags.
- **Enabled tabs** - you can enable/disable any tabs in the Feed Me plugin section.
- **Clear pending tasks** - allowing you to clear out any stuck tasks.
- **License** - enter in your license key for Pro, or use the always-free version.

## Setup

With Feed Me now installed, setup and ready to go, you'll want to [add your first feed](/craft-plugins/feed-me/docs/feature-tour/feed-overview).

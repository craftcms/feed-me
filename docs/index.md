# About Feed Me

Feed Me is a content importing and synchronization plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com). You can set up one-time and repeatable imports to synchronize XML, RSS, ATOM, CSV or JSON feeds with your existing content typesâ€”entries, categories, Craft Commerce products (and variants), and more!

## Features

- Import data from local or remote XML, RSS, ATOM, CSV, or JSON sources.
- Built-in importers for [several element types](content-mapping/element-types.md), plus an extensible [importer API](developers/element-types.md).
- Persistent feed configuration, allowing re-processing via the control panel, webhooks, or CLI (including CRON).
- Sophisticated element-matching and field-mapping interface to get content where it needs to go.
- Automatic duplicate reconciliation for repeated imports.
- Pagination and background processing for large feeds.
- Automatic database backups before each feed processing.
- Troubleshoot feed processing issues with verbose, context-rich logs.
- Use feed data directly in your Twig templates.

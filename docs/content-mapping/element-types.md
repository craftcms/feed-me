# Element Types

Selecting which Element Type to import into is the first step in using Feed Me. As each Element Type is different, you'll have different attributes to map depending on which you'd like to create.

:::tip
Only the [Pro edition](/craft-plugins/feed-me/pricing) of Feed Me supports Assets, Categories, Users, Craft Commerce Products and third-party Element Types.

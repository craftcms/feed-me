# Element Types

Selecting which Element Type to import into is the first step in using Feed Me. As each Element Type is different, you'll have different attributes to map depending on which you'd like to create.

## Built-in Importers

Feed Me can import content for the following element types out of the box:

- **Core element types:** entries, categories, tags, assets, and users
- **[Craft Commerce](https://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce):** products
- **[Digital Products](https://plugins.craftcms.com/digital-products):** digital products
- **[Calendar by Solspace](https://plugins.craftcms.com/calendar):** events
- **[Verbb Comments](https://plugins.craftcms.com/comments):** comments
